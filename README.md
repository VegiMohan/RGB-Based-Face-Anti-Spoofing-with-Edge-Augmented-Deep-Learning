# RGB-Based-Face-Anti-Spoofing-with-Edge-Augmented-Deep-Learning
This project implements a face anti-spoofing system combining RGB images and Canny edge maps as a 4-channel input. Using a modified ResNet-18, it detects real vs. spoof faces by fusing deep features with edge cues, offering an efficient, robust, and practical solution for real-world liveness detection.
